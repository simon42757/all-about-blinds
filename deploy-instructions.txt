GitHub Pages Deployment Instructions:

1. Connect your local repository to GitHub:
   git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/YOUR_REPOSITORY_NAME.git
   git branch -M main
   git push -u origin main

   Replace YOUR_USERNAME with your GitHub username and YOUR_REPOSITORY_NAME with the name you chose for your repository.

2. Set up GitHub Pages:
   - Go to your GitHub repository
   - Click on "Settings"
   - Scroll down to the "GitHub Pages" section
   - For Source, select "GitHub Actions"

3. GitHub Actions will automatically build and deploy your site based on the workflow file we added.

4. After deployment (which takes a few minutes), your site will be available at:
   https://YOUR_USERNAME.github.io/YOUR_REPOSITORY_NAME/

5. You can access this URL from your Android phone or any other device with a web browser!

Note: Any time you push changes to your repository, GitHub Actions will automatically rebuild and redeploy your site.
